### Required tools:

- Testing Handset for Cisco DX series

## I. Physical

1. Examine the phone visually. Look for the following:

	- Deep scratches

	- Worn keys

	- Cracked plastic

	- Damaged display

1. Clean the phone and accessories with Step 1 and a green cloth.


## II. Functional

1. Connect the phone to the Cisco CM Testing System. The phone will power on and boot up.

1. Depending on the firmware version present, the phone may ask you to sign into several accounts and/or set a PIN. Skip all setup and account sign-in. If asked to set a PIN, use `1111`.

1. Navigate to the **Apps** menu (upper right corner of the main screen), then enter the **Settings** app. You may have to swipe over one page to find it.

1. In the **Settings** app, locate the **Backup & Reset** setting and select it. Select **Factory Data Reset** and confirm. You may have to enter the PIN to confirm the reset.

1. The phone will erase and reboot itself, and load the proper firmware version. When the phone is finished, it will display the **Get Started** screen.

1. Skip all setup and account sign-in. If asked to set a PIN, use `1111`.

1. From the main screen, place a test call to another DX-series phone to check the handset, speakerphone, speakerphone mic, camera, audio mute, and video mute keys.

1. End the call, then test the functionality of keys 1-#, the volume key, and the lock key.

1. When all tests are finished, navigate to the **Apps** menu (upper right corner of the main screen), then enter the **Settings** app. You may have to swipe over one page to find it.

1. In the **Settings** app, locate the **About Device** setting and select it. Verify that the firmware version is **10-1-2-33**.

1. Locate the **Backup & Reset** setting and select it. Select **Factory Data Reset** and confirm. You may have to enter the PIN to confirm the reset.

1. The phone may be unplugged when it displays **Cisco DX650**.


## III. Recovery Procedure

1. If the phone will not load the proper firmware version, will not register to the Cisco CM Testing System, or has an unknown PIN, reset it by unplugging, then holding the # key and plugging back in. When the handset LED turns solid red, release the # key and enter 1-# to factory reset the phone.

1. If the phone still does not load the proper firmware version, the phone may have too high of a firmware version loaded on it. Contact an engineer for assistance in downgrading to an intermediate firmware version.


## IV. Packing

1. Pack the phone according to the guidelines in the Phone Packing binder.
