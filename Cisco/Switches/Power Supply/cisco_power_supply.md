# Cisco Power Supply

## Physical

Check the outside for any damage.  Blow out fans on both sides of the power supply.

## Functional

Insert power supply into any X-series switch.  Use a notched power cable to turn the switch on.  Listen for bad fans or erratic power behavior (such as the switch constantly restarting or shutting off.)

When fully booted, type the following commands:

`enable`

`show inventory`

The output should list something like this:

`NAME: "Power Supply X", DESCR: "FRU Power Supply"`

`PID: C3KX-PWR-XXXWAC   , VID: V02  , SN: XXXXXXXXXXX`

## Packing can be powered down and the power supply removed for packing.

Seal power supply in static bag.  Include a notched power cable, and instapack #10 in a normal phone box.
