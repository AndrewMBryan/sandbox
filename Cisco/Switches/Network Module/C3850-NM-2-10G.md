### Required tools:

- Cisco 3650 or 3850 Switch

### Inventory:

- No kit or accessories are needed for this item.

## I. Physical

- Examine the module for physical damage.
	
## II. Functional

1. Power on the test switch next to testing rack and wait for it to boot.

1. Insert the module into the network module slot of the test switch.

1. Configure the switch for testing with the following commands:

	`configure terminal`

	`vlan 45`

	`interface vlan 45`

	`ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0`

	`interface range gigabitEthernet 1/1/1 -4`

	`switchport access vlan 45`
	
	`spanning-tree portfast`
	
	`no shutdown`

	`interface range te 1/1/3-4`

	`switchport access vlan 45`

	`spanning-tree portfast`

	`no shutdown`

	`end`

1. Log into testing switch to configure the 1g and 10g ports for testing.

	1. Type `show vlan` and verify that Gi1/1/1-4 and Te1/1/1-2 are configured to vlan 45.

	1. The testing switch on the rack already has an IP address of 10.0.0.253.

	1. If the ports are not configured type the following.

	`configure terminal`

	`interface range gigabitEthernet 1/1/1 -4`

	`switchport access vlan 45`
	
	`spanning-tree portfast`
	
	`no shutdown`

	`interface range te 1/1/1-2`

	`switchport access vlan 45`

	`spanning-tree portfast`

	`no shutdown`

	`end`

1. Plug the correct SFPs into each switch (1g sfp into Gi ports and 10g into Te ports) and connect with fiber. 

1. Ping each port from a command prompt **(cmd.exe in Windows)** with <1500 bytes.  Use the command `ping -t -l 1200 10.0.0.1` in Windows.

1. Remove the module from the network module slot.

## III. Packing

1. Do a final cleaning of fingerprints and apply inventory and Network Craze stickers upon certification that the module is fully complete.

1. Seal the module in an anti-static bag to be packed for shipping.
