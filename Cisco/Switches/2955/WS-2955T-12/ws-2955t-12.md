# Cisco 2955 Switch

- Inspect the switch according to standard guidelines.
- Ensure the switch has the DC power supply included.
- Start up the switch and ensure all POST tests pass.
- Load the software. Unless otherwise requested use `c2955-i6k2l2q4-mz.121-22.EA14.bin`. Erase the flash and configure an interface to load the image via TFTP. Once loaded, reboot the switch. Make sure to reset the `BOOT` variable in ROMMON to the new image filename.
- Test the ports. Configure all ports with `spanning-tree portfast` and configure an IP address on VLAN 1 for ping testing. Once complete, perform `erase startup-config` and reboot the switch.
- Capture a `show tech` of the switch.
